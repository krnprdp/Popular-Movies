IMPORTANT

The application will crash if tmdb API key is not included in tmdb.java
The Key is required for accessing themoviedb.org database from within the app. Due to copyright reasons, it is illegal to share API key publicly and is hence not included in the code.
You can generate your own API KEY at https://www.themoviedb.org/documentation/api

DESCRIPTION

Most of us can relate to kicking back on the couch and enjoying a movie with friends and family. In this project, we build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.

The application pulls data from themoviedb.org database by using their API and placing remote HTTP calls.
